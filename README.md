# Final Project CSIT 337  
This e-commerence project was done for my CSIT 337 class. This is a non-official shoe store where users are allowed to view products, add to chart, purchase, and lastly track their order. I created this project using PHP for the backend, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and lastly, MySql for the database
